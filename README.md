# Confluence API Connector

**Note**: Need to create a `.env` with the following information:

`GCS_BUCKET_NAME = "gcs-bucket-name"`
`DOMAIN = "your-domain.atlassian.atlassian.net"`
`EMAIL = "serviceaccount@mydomain.com"`
`SPACE_KEY = "OR"`
`API_TOKEN = "#####"`

In the previous example, the URL of the space would be: your-domain.atlassian.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OR/
